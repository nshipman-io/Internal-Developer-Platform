# IDP Web UI

## How was this created

This project is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Specifically, the following commands were run to create it.

```
npm install -g create-react-app@5.0.0
npx create-react-app webapp --template typescript
```

## Run

```
npm install
REACT_APP_API_URL=<API_URL> npm start
```

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode, which means it will watch for changes and hot-reload the page. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
